# HW1
## Devlog
1. Gael Porras, He/Him

2. Our break down in class had three gameobjects which were the player, the plant, and the UI. I used these very same gameobjects and even used the classes we gave them like the player class for movement and planting seeds and the PlantCountUI Class to change the text to match the number of plants planted and remaining.
